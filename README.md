> **影分身の術** — cast the **Shadow Clone Jutsu** on your git repo.

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/demo.svg" alt="kage demo" width="100%"></p>

`kage` runs multiple AI coding-agent sessions against one repo in parallel. The problem it solves:
point two agents at the same checkout and they fight over one working tree — editing the same files,
colliding on branches, tripping over each other's uncommitted changes.

Instead of a shared [`git worktree`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree), kage gives each session
its own **full copy** of the repo in a sibling folder — its own working tree, its own `.git`. Code
comes back through git (a PR, or a branch fetch); the agent's session memory comes back through
`~/.pi`. kage never copies a working tree back onto the origin, so concurrent sessions can't collide.
And like a real Naruto shadow clone, the clone carries the agent's memory out and returns it on
dispel (see [How it works](#how-it-works)).

```bash
npm install -g pi-kage
cd my-app
kage                 # 🥷 clone -> ../my-app--kage-<ts>, open a fresh pi (origin history resumable)
#   ...work in the clone: commit, push, open a PR, quit pi...
kage finish          # 💨 merge the clone's new sessions back, delete the clone
```

## Why a full copy instead of `git worktree`?

A worktree is the obvious way to get a second working directory, but every worktree shares the
repo's single `.git`. For parallel agents that shared `.git` is the problem:

- you can't check out the same branch in two worktrees;
- stash, refs, config, and the index are shared;
- a worktree is a clean checkout — no `node_modules`, `.env`, `.venv`, or build cache — so each one
  needs a full setup pass before the agent can build or run anything.

A full copy has none of those constraints: independent `.git`, independent branches, and every
untracked or gitignored file is already in place. The price is disk and copy time — which on macOS
APFS kage avoids with a `cp -c` clonefile (copy-on-write): the clone is near-instant and uses no
extra space until files actually diverge. Non-reflink filesystems fall back to a full recursive copy.

## Install

```bash
# npm
npm install -g pi-kage     # then use `kage` anywhere
npx pi-kage                # or run without installing

# pnpm
pnpm add -g pi-kage
pnpm dlx pi-kage           # or run without installing

# or install script (no npm needed — kage is a single, zero-dependency Node script)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kid7st/kage/main/install.sh | sh
```

The install script drops the single `kage` file into `~/.local/bin` (override with `KAGE_BIN_DIR`,
pin a version with `KAGE_VERSION`). kage has **no dependencies** — it only needs Node, git, and pi.

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kid7st/kage
cd kage && npm install && npm link   # `npm install` builds bin/kage.mjs from src/ (TypeScript)
```

Requires **git**, [**pi**](https://github.com/earendil-works), and **Node ≥ 18** on your `PATH`.

## Lifecycle

```
  origin repo (you)                         shadow clone (independent copy)
  ─────────────────                         ──────────────────────────────
  $ kage --name fix-login   ─copy + history─►  ../my-app--fix-login
                                              $ pi      (fresh session; origin history resumable)
                                                · git switch -c fix-login
                                                · edit / commit / push / open PR
                                                · quit pi
  $ kage finish fix-login   ◄─new sessions──  (the clone's .jsonl, copied back)
        · safety check (committed? pushed?)
        · merge the clone's new sessions into ~/.pi
        · delete the clone folder
  code arrives via the merged GitHub PR ✓
```

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/code/my-app

kage                       # clone . → ../my-app--kage-<ts>, open a fresh pi (origin history resumable)
kage --name fix-login      # name the clone folder: ../my-app--fix-login
kage /path/to/other-repo   # clone a different repo (path defaults to cwd)

# back in the origin after you quit the clone's pi:
kage                       # no args inside a repo with clones -> interactive menu
kage status                # status dashboard: branch · dirty · ahead/behind · safe-to-clean
kage status --pr           # also show PR state (via gh)
kage finish fix-login      # check → merge the clone's new sessions back → delete the clone
kage finish fix-login --pr # push the branch + open a PR (via gh), then finish
kage finish --force        # skip the uncommitted/unpushed guard
kage rm old-experiment     # discard a clone without merging (refuses if it has local-only work)

# inside a clone, to retrieve a non-git file (e.g. a generated .env):
kage pull .env config/local.json
```

With no arguments inside a repo that already has clones, `kage` shows an interactive picker: create a
new clone, or select an existing one to **enter** (`pi -c`), **finish**, or **remove**. `finish` and `rm`
show the same picker when you have multiple clones and don't name one.

### Shell integration (optional)

```bash
eval "$(kage shell-init)"   # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
```

This wraps `kage` so that `finish`/`rm` run from inside a clone **cd you back to the origin**
automatically (a CLI can't change its parent shell's directory otherwise), and adds tab completion
for subcommands and clone names.

### Commands

| Command | Run from | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `kage [path] [--name x]` | origin repo | Copy the repo to `../<repo>--<name>` (default `kage-<ts>`), copy the origin's 5 most recent pi sessions into the clone (resumable there, never replayed), and launch a **fresh** `pi` session. `--name` only names the folder — kage never creates a branch. With no args (and existing clones) it opens an interactive picker. |
| `kage status [--pr]` | origin repo | Status dashboard of clones: branch, dirty/clean, ahead/behind upstream, and a “safe to clean” flag. `--pr` adds PR state via `gh`. (`kage list` is a kept alias.) |
| `kage finish [name] [--force] [--push] [--pr]` | origin, inside the clone, or anywhere with a clone path | Refuse if the clone has uncommitted or unpushed work (`--force` overrides), merge the clone's **new** sessions back (copied-in origin history is skipped), then delete the clone. `--push` pushes the branch first; `--pr` pushes and opens a PR via `gh`. Auto-selects / prompts when there are several. |
| `kage rm [name] [--force]` | origin, inside the clone, or anywhere with a clone path | Discard a clone **without** merging memory. Refuses if it has local-only work unless `--force`. For abandoned experiments. `name` may be a clone name (run from the repo) or a path to the clone folder (works from anywhere). |
| `kage pull <path...>` | inside a clone | Copy specific files/dirs (even gitignored ones) back to the origin at the same relative path. |
| `kage shell-init` | shell rc | Print a shell wrapper (cd-back after `finish`/`rm`) + tab completion. Use `eval "$(kage shell-init)"`. |
| `kage --help` / `--version` | anywhere | Usage / version. |

## How it works

Four invariants keep parallel work safe and lossless:

1. **Isolation** — a clone is a full independent copy with its own `.git`. kage **doesn't create a
   branch**: the clone stays on the origin's current branch and kage stays out of git flow entirely,
   so you decide your own branching/PR workflow inside the clone (instruct the agent via your
   `AGENTS.md`).
2. **Code flows back via git, never the working tree.** With a remote you push the branch and merge a
   PR. With **no remote**, `finish` fetches the clone's branch into the origin's git as a local
   `kage/<name>-<sha>` branch (origin's working tree untouched — `git merge` it when you like; the short
   sha keeps the ref unique so reusing a name never collides). kage never copies the clone's working
   tree onto the origin — that would re-create the collisions it avoids — so `finish` refuses to delete
   **uncommitted** work, which a fetch can't preserve.
3. **Memory flows through `~/.pi`, never replayed.** On create, the origin's 5 most recent session
   `.jsonl` files are copied into the clone — `pi`'s resume picker surfaces them, but the clone opens a
   **fresh** session (kage never replays turns or fakes a resumed conversation). On `finish`, sessions
   the clone created are copied back whole; an unchanged copied-in session adds nothing; and a
   copied-in session you *resumed and added to* comes back as a **new, self-contained** session — so
   the origin's original session (the leaf pi would resume) is never mutated and your turns aren't lost.
4. **The origin is read-only to kage** — it only copies out and writes session memory; it never
   touches the origin's working tree, even while another session is live there.

With a remote configured, `finish` nudges you to push first (so PR-flow mistakes surface) unless you
pass `--push` / `--pr` / `--force`.

## Notes & caveats

- The copy is a snapshot of the origin's **current** state, **including uncommitted changes**.
- **Submodules**: a submodule's `.git` pointer is an absolute path and breaks on copy — run
  `git submodule update --init` in the clone.
- Non-APFS / non-reflink filesystems fall back to a full (heavier) copy.
- Session storage is assumed at `~/.pi/agent/sessions`; override with `KAGE_SESSIONS_DIR`.

## Development

The CLI and its tests are written in TypeScript and compiled with `tsc`:

- `src/kage.mts` → `bin/kage.mjs` — a single, zero-runtime-dependency file (the only thing the
  install script + npm package ship).
- `test/kage.test.mts` → `dist/kage.test.mjs` — black-box `node:test` smoke tests that spawn the
  built CLI (compiled to `dist/` so they run on every Node in CI, no TS loader needed).

`bin/` and `dist/` are build artifacts — both gitignored. `bin/` is produced on `npm install`
(via `prepare`), so `npm link` from a clone just works.

Linting/formatting is handled by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) — a dev-only dependency that never
ships in the package, so the zero-runtime-dependency artifact is unaffected.

```bash
npm run build    # tsc: src/kage.mts -> bin/kage.mjs
npm run format   # biome: auto-format + safe lint fixes
npm run lint     # biome (lint + format check) + tsc type check (src + test)
npm test         # build CLI + tests, then run node:test smoke tests (temp repos, no network)
```

Releases publish automatically: bump `version` in `package.json`, then

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main vX.Y.Z
```

CI runs lint + tests and `npm publish --provenance` on any `v*` tag.
